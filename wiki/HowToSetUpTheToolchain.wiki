= Setting Up the Toolchain =

  # Download the GNU/Linux toolchain [http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/release1293 here].
  # Once the download is complete open up terminal and type {{{chmod 755 /path/to/downloadedfile.bin}}} followed by {{{/path/to/downloadedfile.bin}}} or if it is in your current directory {{{./downloadedfile.bin}}}
  # If it complains about your system using dash instead of bash execute the command {{{dpkg-reconfigure dash}}} and select no when prompted.
  # You should now be in the installer.  Install it as you would any other program to any path you like.  All documents in this project will use {{{~/android/toolchain/}}} as the directory to install to.

  Your toolchain should now be set up properly.
